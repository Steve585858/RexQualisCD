2. A folder labeled "Code" which contains example programs for many of the chapters in the tutorial.  To use these examples, just click on the file named for the code and your Arduino application will launch with the sample program already in it, ready to upload.  Remember you may need to update the Library!

3. A folder labeled "Libraries", that contains additional libraries your Arduino software may need for certain applications. Preface of the tutorial explains how to use these libraries.

4. A folder labeled "Datasheets", that contains the datasheets of all electronic components in the kit.
